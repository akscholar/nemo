.TH CCDCROSS 1NEMO "18 April 2024"

.SH "NAME"
ccdcross \- cross correlate images with a reference image

.SH "SYNOPSIS"
\fBccdcross\fP [parameter=value]

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
\fBccdcross\fP finds the optimal offset one (or more) images and a reference image based on the
cross-correlation between two images.  By selecting a specific \fBcenter=\fP and
half \fBbox=\fP size, one can focus on a specific area, assuming the offset is less than
the box-size.
.PP
The centroid is determined using an intensity weighted mean in the correllated image.
A future version may fit
a 2D gaussian or appropriate function to the correllation image.

.SH "PARAMETERS"
.so man1/parameters
.TP 20
\fBin=\fP\fIref,im1,...\fP
Input image files, first image is the reference image. At least two images need
to be given. No default.
.TP
\fBout=\fP\fIim\fP
Output cross image. No default.
.TP
\fBcenter=\fP\fIx0,y0\fP
X-Y Reference center around which a box (see \fBbox=\fP below) is taken.
The are 0-based integer pixels. By default the center of the image
is used.  Default: center of first input image.
.TP
\fBbox=\fP\fIb2\fP
Half size of correlation box. The output image is forced to have an odd pixel size, 2*box+1.
The shift between the images should not exceed \fBbox\fP.
By default half the mapsize is used. 
.TP
\fBclip=\fP\fIc\fP
Only use values above this clip level in the original images. By default values are not clipped.
.TP
\fBbad=\fP\fIb\fP
bad value to ignore. By default there is no bad value recognized.

.SH "CAVEAT"
Only 2D images are handled.
.PP
The WCS is ignored, 0-based pixel coordinates are reported.
.PP
Images should ideally be the same size, but nothing will stop the program from
running off without that. The user is then responsible for computing the true offsets
as all bets are off.

.SH "EXAMPLES"

Here two gaussian shaped sources with noise are created with a small 1 pixel offset from
each other.
