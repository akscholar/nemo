If your type of package manager is not listed
here, also consult the files in $NEMO/src/scripts/linux
or $NEMO/src/scripts/darwin.

The top-level Makefile also have targets to install these, 
viz. for debian type systems:

	make install_apt

or for redhat type systems:

	make install_dnf

These are enough to get a very basic NEMO compiled.
