Here are some simple OPENMP examples.
If compiled with openmp, NEMO will show this when debug=1 is used:
   ### nemo Debug Info: omp_get_max_threads() -> 8  [OMP_NUM_THREADS]
otherwise it would not show this.

Some examples of usage:

sections
--------
   This program uses the "#pragma sections" as well as for
   It also seems to shows that multiple sections cannot split up the for loop,


OMP_NUM_THREADS=4 sections iter=10000

No openmp:

To measure the performance an example of the output from /usr/bin/time on program with N threads
can be processed with the amdahl.py script. Example is the heated plate, which is pretty good:

# on an i5-1135G7 ./heated_plate_openmp
